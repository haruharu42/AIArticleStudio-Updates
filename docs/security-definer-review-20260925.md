# Authenticated SECURITY DEFINER Review — 2026-09-25

Scope: live Supabase project for AI Action Studio (AAS).

This document records the review outcome; it is not a permanent exemption list. Re-run the live advisor and re-read function definitions before future security changes.

## Current advisor state

After converting the zero-argument release-state wrapper to SECURITY INVOKER:

- authenticated SECURITY DEFINER executable WARN: 135
- anon SECURITY DEFINER executable WARN: 0
- auth leaked-password protection WARN: 1
- extension-in-public WARN: 1 (`pg_net`)
- RLS-enabled-with-no-policy INFO: 35
- performance: only unused-index INFO remained at the time of review

## Guard-path classification

Among the 135 authenticated-callable SECURITY DEFINER functions:

- 89 contain `private.is_active_admin()`
- 8 contain `private.assert_notification_feature_access()`
- 123 contain a direct `auth.uid()` check
- 1 is delegated/indirect without a direct guard in its own body

Counts overlap because an admin function can contain both `auth.uid()` and `private.is_active_admin()`.

## Delegated/indirect function

### `create_article_with_workspace(p_article jsonb, p_workspace jsonb)`

Reason to keep SECURITY DEFINER for now:

1. It calls `public.create_article(...)`, which is the single source for:
   - authenticated user identity
   - active profile validation
   - supported role validation
   - article quota
   - ownership
   - payload validation/normalization
2. After the article is created, it inserts the matching `article_workspaces` row using the created article's user ID.
3. Switching this wrapper to SECURITY INVOKER without redesigning workspace table permissions can break the atomic article + workspace creation path.

Action: keep intentional for now. If this path is redesigned later, prefer a non-exposed/private privileged implementation with a narrow public API.

## Wrapper changed to SECURITY INVOKER

### `get_my_app_release_state()`

The zero-argument overload only calls:

`public.get_my_app_release_state('public')`

The audience-aware overload already performs user/profile/release-tester validation and remains the privileged implementation. The zero-argument wrapper did not need owner privileges.

Verification performed before recording the migration:

- authenticated tester-equivalent call succeeded
- returned `signed_in=true`
- returned `active=true`
- advisor authenticated SECURITY DEFINER count decreased by one

## Intentional exposed privileged categories

Do not bulk-revoke these without per-function review.

### Admin operations

Admin-prefixed/administrative functions use the active-admin guard before returning or mutating privileged data.

### Notification self-service

V2 notification preference/read/subscription wrappers call the notification feature-access guard before delegating to the underlying implementation.

### Per-user privileged operations

A large set of self-service functions use `auth.uid()` plus profile/ownership/status checks to perform operations that direct table RLS intentionally does not expose.

## Remaining security work

1. Review/enable Supabase Auth leaked-password protection before broad public account growth.
2. Review `pg_net` placement/use before any extension-schema change. It is actively used by Knowledge automation and notification push worker invocation, so moving/dropping it blindly is unsafe.
3. Continue reviewing SECURITY DEFINER functions feature-by-feature when touched; do not change them solely to reduce advisor counts.
4. Re-run security advisors after each DB privilege/function change.
